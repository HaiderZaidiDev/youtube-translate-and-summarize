<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We found that many YouTube videos didn't have accurate transcriptions and translations, which serves as a very big barrier for people who have hearing disabilities.

## How it Works
It uses modules to download youtube videos, change them to an audio format, and send it to Google's speech-to-text. It then grammar checks the transcription, translates it, and then summarizes it.
